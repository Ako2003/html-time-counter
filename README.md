# Express Static Files Server

## Overview
This project is a simple Express server designed to serve static files, particularly an index.html file, from the same directory as the server script (index.js). The server uses the Express framework to handle HTTP requests and serve the index.html file when accessed.

## Project Structure
The project consists of the following files:

- index.js: The main server script that sets up the Express application, serves static files, and defines routes.
- index.html: A sample HTML file that will be served by the Express server.
- .gitignore: A file specifying files and directories to be ignored by Git, including the node_modules directory.
- package.json: Node.js project configuration file.

## Usage
1. Place your index.html file in the same directory as index.js.
2. Install project dependencies by running npm install.
3. Start the server by running npm start or node index.js.
4. Access the server at http://localhost:3000/ in your web browser.

## Dependencies
- Express: Web application framework for Node.js.
- path: Node.js module for working with file and directory paths.

## Why Use This Project?
This project simplifies the process of serving static files using Express. It's useful for small projects or prototypes where a full-fledged web server isn't required, and you want a quick way to serve HTML files and other static assets.

Feel free to customize the project according to your specific needs and add more features as necessary.
